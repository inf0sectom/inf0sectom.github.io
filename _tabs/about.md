Hi, Iâ€™m **inf0sectom** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a cybersecurity practitioner with a strong background in **endpoint protection**, **risk management**, and **vulnerability management**. After several years on the defensive side, and earning the **CISSP** certification, Iâ€™m now branching into **offensive security** and pursuing the **OSCP+**.

My current focus areas include **web application security** and **Linux/Windows penetration testing**. My next field of inquiry will be **IoT security research**.

This site is where I will share my security research, notes, and study plans. Hopefully itâ€™ll be useful not just as my personal knowledge base, but also for anyone else walking a similar path!
